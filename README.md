### PDFSafe
PDfSafe is a dapp built on the Aeternity and Ipfs Platform for saving pdf in a decentralized way.
It makes use of both ipfs and the aeternity platform.
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.IPFS allows users to not only receive but host content, in a similar manner to BitTorrent. As opposed to a centrally located server, IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing.
Ã¦ternity is a new blockchain technology, designed to deliver unmatched efficiency, transparent governance and global scalability
